# TU-Bot
This is a practical implementation of a multi-purpose Discord bot with the intended use for professors and students to effectively communicate and use meaningful tools in the Discord application. With the hardest parts of quarantine behind us, many students and professors have created Discord accounts and Discord servers to communicate effectively with each other. In the online semesters, many students have picked up the platform and now use it in their everyday life for not just school â€“ as Discord has created a social platform for students to create friendships and properly communicate and collaborate on schoolwork. TU Bot is a concept that strives to be used in all Temple University affiliated servers, with a large scope of helpful tools and commands that would be used for professors and students so that they can make the Discord platform even more convenient for them. Meaningful tools include things like appointment schedulers, academic reminders, categorized/organized notifications, group creators, collaboration toolkits etc. If development time allows it, the bot will strive to web-scrape Canvas for even more uses, perhaps with real-time notifications from Canvas.
